# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Found a neat React course by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja). Then did my first Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts:** Frontend Mentor is amazing. It's like Codewars but for frontend stuff. The first challenge I completed was very basic, so I really hope I didn't mess it up ðŸ˜….

### Day 1: January 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created my first React app. Learned about dynamic values and used it to create a paragraph that generates a random number using {Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)}.

**Thoughts**: I can already see why React is very powerful. The ability to combine JavaScript logic with frontend tools unlocks a lot of possibilities (imagine a Tesla UI but in a web browser!).

### Day 2: January 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about React components, click events, props, and useState hooks. Used my knowledge to create a click counter (demo below).

**Thoughts** React is starting to come together for me. My first basic app has shown me first-hand why React is very powerful. Also, I'm starting to think that React is actually rather fun - I thought that it'd be less fun than Svelte but I guess I was wrong.

### Day 3: January 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to output a list in React.

**Thoughts** It's not as fancy as Svelte but it gets the job done. It also feels more native (Svelte uses some crazy syntax to output lists). React is becoming very fun.

### Day 4: January 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use functions and props.

**Thoughts** Using props as functions is important because sometimes you want the component to be able to manipulate the data it receives. For that, you would need to create the event handler outside of the component and pass the function as a prop so that it can be access within the component.

### Day 5: January 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the useEffect hook

**Thoughts** TBH I still don't know the use cases for this hook. After all I haven't worked with the backend before. Also, I had to take a break but not for this long! Will try not to do it again.

### Day 6: February 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about TailwindCSS basics.

**Thoughts** Tailwind is streamlined. There are a pre-defined set of choices for each style so I wouldn't need to tinker around too much. I'm curious to how responsive design will work, however.

**Work(s)**: ![A code snippet showing an HTML header with two divs styled using Tailwind classes.](media/tailwind-basics.png)
