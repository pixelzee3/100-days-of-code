# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Found a neat React course by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja). Then did my first Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts:** Frontend Mentor is amazing. It's like Codewars but for frontend stuff. The first challenge I completed was very basic, so I really hope I didn't mess it up ðŸ˜….

### Day 1: January 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created my first React app. Learned about dynamic values and used it to create a paragraph that generates a random number using {Math.floor(Math.random() \* 10)}.

**Thoughts**: I can already see why React is very powerful. The ability to combine JavaScript logic with frontend tools unlocks a lot of possibilities (imagine a Tesla UI but in a web browser!).

### Day 2: January 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about React components, click events, props, and useState hooks. Used my knowledge to create a click counter (demo below).

**Thoughts** React is starting to come together for me. My first basic app has shown me first-hand why React is very powerful. Also, I'm starting to think that React is actually rather fun - I thought that it'd be less fun than Svelte but I guess I was wrong.

### Day 3: January 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to output a list in React.

**Thoughts** It's not as fancy as Svelte but it gets the job done. It also feels more native (Svelte uses some crazy syntax to output lists). React is becoming very fun.

### Day 4: January 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use functions and props.

**Thoughts** Using props as functions is important because sometimes you want the component to be able to manipulate the data it receives. For that, you would need to create the event handler outside of the component and pass the function as a prop so that it can be access within the component.

**Work(s)**: ![A code snippet showing a use case for using functions as props](media/react-functions-as-props.png)

### Day 5: January 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the useEffect hook

**Thoughts** TBH I still don't know the use cases for this hook. After all I haven't worked with the backend before. Also, I had to take a break but not for this long! Will try not to do it again.

### Day 6: February 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about TailwindCSS basics.

**Thoughts** Tailwind is streamlined. There are a pre-defined set of choices for each style so I wouldn't need to tinker around too much. I'm curious to how responsive design will work, however.

**Work(s)**: ![A code snippet showing an HTML header with two divs styled using Tailwind classes.](media/tailwind-basics.png)

### Day 7: February 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Read through the TailwindCSS docs.

**Thoughts** I don't think I can use TailwindCSS without reading the docs. There are so many things to remember! Also, it has been a rough few weeks - I haven't been able to code consistently. However, I want to begin prioritizing #100DaysOfCode because learning how to code will unlock me many opportunities.

### Day 8: February 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made an NFT card component using TailwindCSS as a Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts** I'm far from a Tailwind master, but I can already feel like I can style faster. This just goes to show how rapid TailwindCSS is!

### Day 9: February 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a new Discord bot.

**Thoughts** I feel like the technologies I have been learning (Parcel, TypeScript, etc.). They help me manage my project but they are also very difficult to set up.

### Day 10: February 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Back to React! I learned how to fetch data using the useEffect hook. I then made a useFetch hook that can also handle fetch errors!

**Thoughts** I now know why useEffect is an important hook! Fetching data from servers is a lot more complicated than I imagined.

**Work(s)**: ![A React hook I made called useFetch.](media/react-useeffect-hook.png)

### Day 11: February 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to use the react-router-dom to make websites multi-page.

**Thoughts** I think making multiple pages in React is much more elegant than making multiple HTML pages.

**Work(s)**: ![A React website with multiple routes.](media/recat-router-dom.png)

### Day 12: February 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learned about React route parameters, controlled inputs/forms, submit events, redirects, and 404 pages.

**Thoughts** I think I'm ready enough to create my own websites using React. I'm very excited.

### Day 13: March 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a Frontend Mentor component using TailwindCSS. I still need to implement responsive design and implement hover states.

**Thoughts** I want to practice my frontend styling skills.

### Day 14: March 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I completed the Frontend Mentor component I've been working on! Made with TailwindCSS.

**Thoughts** I think great planning will allow me to practice my front-end skills well.
