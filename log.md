# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Found a neat React course by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja). Then did my first Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts:** Frontend Mentor is amazing. It's like Codewars but for frontend stuff. The first challenge I completed was very basic, so I really hope I didn't mess it up ðŸ˜….

### Day 1: January 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created my first React app. Learned about dynamic values and used it to create a paragraph that generates a random number using {Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)}.

**Thoughts**: I can already see why React is very powerful. The ability to combine JavaScript logic with frontend tools unlocks a lot of possibilities (imagine a Tesla UI but in a web browser!).

### Day 2: January 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about components, click events, props, and useState hooks. Used my knowledge to create a click counter (demo below).

**Thoughts** React is starting to come together for me. My first basic app has shown me first-hand why React is very powerful. Also, I'm starting to think that React is actually rather fun - I thought that it'd be less fun than Svelte but I guess I was wrong.
