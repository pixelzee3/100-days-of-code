# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Found a neat React course by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja). Then did my first Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts:** Frontend Mentor is amazing. It's like Codewars but for frontend stuff. The first challenge I completed was very basic, so I really hope I didn't mess it up ðŸ˜….

### Day 1: January 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created my first React app. Learned about dynamic values and used it to create a paragraph that generates a random number using {Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)}.

**Thoughts**: I can already see why React is very powerful. The ability to combine JavaScript logic with frontend tools unlocks a lot of possibilities (imagine a Tesla UI but in a web browser!).

<!-- ### Day 2: June 27, 2016 (Example 3)

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
