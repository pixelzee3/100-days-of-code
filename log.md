# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Found a neat React course by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja). Then did my first Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts:** Frontend Mentor is amazing. It's like Codewars but for frontend stuff. The first challenge I completed was very basic, so I really hope I didn't mess it up ðŸ˜….

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
